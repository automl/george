George
======

George is a fast and flexible Python library for Gaussian Process (GP)
Regression. A full introduction to the theory of Gaussian Processes is beyond
the scope of this documentation but the best resource is available for free
online: `Rasmussen & Williams (2006) <http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/>`_.

Unlike some other GP implementations, george is focused on efficiently
evaluating the marginalized likelihood of a dataset under a GP prior, even as
this dataset gets Bigâ„¢. As you'll see in these pages of documentation, the
module exposes quite a few other features but it is designed to be used
alongside your favorite `non-linear optimization
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html>`_
or `posterior inference <http://dfm.io/emcee>`_ library for the best results.

George is being actively developed in `a public repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/dfm/george>`_ so if you have any trouble, `open an issue
<https://github.com/dfm/george/issues>`_ there.
